############### INSTRUCTIONS ###############

# 1. this is the directory on your computer where all the input files are located

# 2. this is the folder in which all outputs will be written, it may or may not already exist 

# 3. this is the digital elevation model of your study area.
# Accepted extensions are .txt or .asc
# e.g. ASCII file exported from QGIS with the gdal_translate function
# Best resampled to a reasonably low resolution before importing it.
# If not, computational time increases
# The Input Coordinate Reference System must be WGS1984
# Make sure that the first 6 rows of the .asc or .txt file are the following:
# ncols
# nrows
# xllcorner
# yllcorner
# cellsize
# NODATA_value

# 4. One or more erosional map filenames, separated by a space.
# These are rasters, where each cell informs the local erosional weight.
# Please avoid including areas with zero erosion.
# Extremely low erosion rates should be assigned a value orders of magnitude lower than the other ones.
# Accepted coordinate reference system and format, same as 3.
# This parameter can also be left empty.

# 5. Filename of the bedrock mineral fertility map of the study area.
# This is a raster, where each cell informs a local weight of mineral fertility.
# Accepted coordinate reference system and format, same as 4. and 3.
# This parameter can also be left empty

# 6. Filename of the watershed outline with .shp extension (Shapefile)
# The input folder should also contain a .shx file with the same name,
# This is automatically created during shapefile export from any GIS software
# If zero erosion areas are desired, the watershed polygon shouldexclude these

# 7. Input bedrock ages filename, as .xlsx or .csv format
# This should be a table with the following header:
# latitude, longitude, elevation, age, age_u, zero_age_depth
# age and age_u: the age and related uncertainty in million years
# zero_age_depth: the depth at which the thermochronometric ages are reset.
# this latter column can be blank, in which case the depth is assigned to be elevation-5000 m
# coordinates must be WGS1984 values
# elevation and zero_age_depth are in meters above sea level

# 8. One or more detrital grain-age populations, .xlsx or .csv format, separated by a space
# These should have at least 2 columns labeled age and age_u
# Any other column will be ignored
# This parameter can also be left empty in case of exploratory runs

# 9. This is the target resolution of the interpolated surface in meters

# 10. If true, 2 example erosion scenarios will be tested
# these are:
# i) exponential increase with elevation
# ii) exponential decrease with elevation
# additional scenarios other than the imported maps can be added by editing the code in the jupyter notebook.

# 11. This indicates the interpolation method to be used, options are:
# rbf - linear Radial Basis Function
# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.Rbf.html#scipy.interpolate.Rbf
# int - 3D linear interpolation
# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.griddata.html#scipy.interpolate.griddata
# ext - same as int, but additionally extrapolates ages outside of the convex interpolation hull
# zln - each z gets assigned an age based on a linear regression of age-elevation data.
# imp - import your own age map and uncertainty (ASCII files referenced in WGS1984, same as 3.)

# 12. If ext is chosen as interpolation method, an inverse-distance-weight is used to assign ages
# to the cells out of the interpolation hull, but not farther than this search radius, expressed in meters.
# This parameter can also be left empty

# 13/14. If imp is chosen as interpolation method, these indicate the filenames of
# the interpolated surface bedrock age map and the related uncertainty in %
# both must be ASCII files referenced in WGS1984, like 3.
# These parameters can also be left empty
